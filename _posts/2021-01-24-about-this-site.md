## 1. A Portfolio

Eventually, this site will have links highlighting some of my projects and accomplishments. 

*Professional*

 - Resume 
 - Technical Portfolio 
 - Academic Accomplishments

 *Fun*

 - Music Projects and Videos
 - DIY/Homemade 
 - Other Random Stuf

## 2. A Blog

Will also have some short and longer form writing here. The custom website format can allow for more creative pieces above and beyond simple text provided by the template. Some types of writing: 

### Stories and life experiences

Some fun and not-so-fun life excerpts, reflections on experiences, and other 1st-person narratives

### Mistakes and lessons learned

Somewhat of an anti-portfolio, will try to highlight my numerous failures here. A big part of success is just luck -- sharing failures can put that success in context. Wish it was a bit more socially normal to share fails.

Some unsolicited advice to my past self, featuring insights learned and plenty of hindsight. Hopefully a bit of the advice can be useful to others too?

### Thoughts and ideas

Lots of introspection and hot takes about random topics.

A purely custom website might allow for some really cool evidence-based articles where the evidence gets embedded into the article itself. Or some sort of interactive infographic. We'll see what sort of magic JavaScript can do

### Reviews

Mostly posting content about stuff I really enjoyed, like

- Published content (books, articles, movies, tv shows)

- Purchased content (Fav things I bought, good quality/value stuff)

- Internet tips/tricks I learned (Good websites, free stuff, other cool tech)

## 3. A Creative Challenge

This website was a fun project, building something fun online. This website is built completely from scratch, so every part of it is customizable, from the technical side to the creative:

*Technical stuff:*
- Hosting platform, [github](https://pages.github.com/)
- Static site generator, [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Domain name via GoDaddy and the convienent _de_ extension used in Germany (akashbor.de)

*Creative stuff* 
- Site Structure and Design, built in HTML and CSS
- Interactive site content with JavaScript
