# How to workflow

(how to do a list again?)
Upload just the markdown raw text
Ideally theres a sidebar generated by it


Front matter looks like this:
> title: "The title goes here"
> permalink: "Link to permalink"
> tags and / or categories

# Site stuff

Send it to laptop or tablet
Jekyll build
Jekyll serve
check for any oddities

# Git stuff

Git push and watch it run
