# To Do
- Streamline workflow, learn frontmatter bit better
- Change color scheme
- Don't like the "RSS" link
- Delete old generated posts
- Add descriptions for each article
- Make sure the default pulls from the title
- Delete "akashbor.de" at the top, use something else as the title
- Get rid of "Donate"
- Put "Portfolio" as a resume for now at least


# Workflow

1. Write up thoughts in OneNote
2. Copy to text file, make sure markdown looks ok
3. Add frontmatter:
Front matter looks like this:
> title: "The title goes here"
> permalink: "Link to permalink"
> tags and / or categories
4. Add as a new post in _posts
5. Jekyll build
6. Jekyll serve to check
7. Git push origin master
