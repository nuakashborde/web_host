  February Goals (New)

- Post a video about hairball and streets advocacy work (get ready with me). Could be a good lead-in to the EMSC committee! Follow up with Keka on this.
- Come up with a startups resume (for Josh Cohen, Carla Pinzon, etc)
- Apply to at least one fellowship that Troy sent, and make a ranked priority list
- Come up with plan to become a real embedded systems engineer (lessons and project)
- Book March Travel. Come up with rough plan for May/June and Sept travels.
- Use the alaska airlines pointssss
- Book new doctors appt with new insurance

January outstanding goals
- Finish and circulate Memorandum of Understanding (new name for this doc), then circulate it
- Create and publish the first newsletter

- “improve district 9” - I think regular contact with the PNA, Safe Streets Bernal, and a Mission group would be a good start. D9 neighbors for housing too. Just regular contacts would be a good start.

- Finish Muni Takes logo (use ai if chloe doesn’t pull thru)
- Write substack post about hairball (script for video?)
- Open twitter/threads accounts
- Have a super basic ugly but linked website. everything lands and links from a one-page. add animations later.

- Keep selling from the IRA accounts
- Check the 401k investment choices (both fidelity and voya), make sure they’re not garbage
- Keep moving the HSA account </pre>

Hello 
This is my monthly write up for progress on my goals. Every month I'm going to write up the goals I had and the progress I made on those goals. Hopefully over time, writing these recaps helps me improve progress over time.

I'll try to get February's goals posted by Tuesday night.

Thanks
Akash

Overall:
	•	Technology for Improving People's Lives Goal: 5.3/10
	•	Improving People's Lives Locally: 8.3/10
	•	Spreading Good Ideas: Rating: 3.3/10
	•	Personal Finance To Do's: Rating: 8.6/10
 
 
Global Energy Access
Explanation: This is my current "technology for social impact" project. I am working on a project to improve metering for microgrid developers in African countries to better deploy meters and bring electricity for millions of people.
Rating: 5.3/10
Notes: I basically kept the project moving (average between some really good weeks and really not-caring weeks). It would be better if I increased effort on this and reached some sort of all-in/all-out stage. I think this is a good goal for February.
 
 
Write a clear Memorandum of Understanding
Explanation: Write a document outlining the goals and rules for the Alliance working on this project.
Rating: 8/10
Notes: I spent decent effort preparing for our weekly calls and preparing this document. However, a pivot requested by one of the members in Africa required us to take more time and research legal incorporation in an African country. This slowed progress and I lost some interest as well. A recent conversation has allowed us to refocus our efforts on getting a document signed, and decouple that from legal incorporation.
 
 
Get approval from all 5 parties: 
Explanation: Convince and discuss with all members of the Alliance on the project to fully buy in to the document.
Rating: 5/10
Notes: I have gotten a lot better at hosting and leading these calls, keeping people motivated (brought back some contributors and got in touch with some of the people directly to kickstart progress). It is a delicate balance to keep volunteers engaged without paying them, and keeping focus and progress moving. 
 
Create proposal to show 9zero and friends/family. It should have the background research about metering ready.
Explanation: The goal is to be able to start writing and speaking about this and pitching/raising money for it externally.
Rating: 3/10
Notes: I went to a pitch event for labstart, where I talked about this to several people. I also went to 9zero a bunch. However, I did no actual work creating the proposal or doing behind the simple questions that people ask about this project.
 
 
Improving Lives Locally in SF
Start fixing problems! Right in front of me! Get some wins!
Rating: 8.3/10
 
 
Establish rapport with Supervisor Office - provide regular updates
Explanation: Become a regular helper for my most local elected representative.
Rating: 10/10
Notes: Crushed this one. Wrote up a nice email to my supervisor's office with my progress and interest in getting more involved locally. Was received really well. Meeting another local community organizer in the Mission as a direct result of this, and going to be working on a road safety map as well as potentially a homelessness project too (at least an intro)?
 
Provide an update on the Hairball
Explanation: The hairball is the name of a dangerous intersection I live near. I made a petition to get some momentum for fixing it. I want to provide the reply-ees an update on progress.
Rating: 10/10
Notes:  Wrote a banger update (as a result of this goal). Otherwise I would have been sitting on this for more weeks lol
 
Create form / list for people to improve District 9
Explanation: I think this was to circulate notice that I can address local challenges. It is a poorly phrased goal though.
Rating: 5/10
Notes: As a result of the two goals above in this section, I have circulated notice to some parties that I am working on this project. And I got a link to an intersections map which partially covers this. Next up, though, is to post this on my socials.
 
Spreading Good Ideas
How do I improve my reach! I have ideas on fixing the world's problems! I want them to spread far and wide! 
Rating: 3.3/10
 
Launch 2x Muni Takes Videos 
Explanation: Parody of the Subway Takes guy. Use the popularity of Muni Run Club to launch a short-form podcast?
Rating: 8/10
Notes: Only booked and recorded one. But most of the work was getting all the set up figured out. The camera I bought (and returned) turned out to be optimized for the wrong  type of video I got a 360 cam, which is fun and has high resolution, but not useful for zoomed in shots. I have a waitlist of people wanting to join the podcast tho :). And I figured out the microphones, train, mount, and a decent amount of the editing.
 
Post 1x substack article and 3x tweets 
Explanation: The goal is really to start getting longer form ideas and writing out into the world. 
Rating: 1/10
Notes: Maybe this was too ambitious (although my ideas are plentiful). I think I need to lower my bar for posting content. And dedicate more time to posting (meaning I need to cut time from something else)
 
Link socials to website 
Explanation: I have far too many separate, parallel social contents. I need a unified place where people (on socials and off it) can go find me. I want to have a single point of reach for people on and off socials, and to bring people from my many projects to one place.
Rating: 2/10
Notes: I made zero progress on this unifying concept. But I'm giving myself a point for posting on my music channels and 1 on the run club channel. Strava is also going strongly.
 
Personal Finance
A few items that were stuck in a big mental block and had slow but long-term financial impacts (e.g. fees, future taxes, and making sure that cash is not sitting around losing value to inflation, but rather invested)
Rating: 8.6/10
 
Figure out IRA account mess - consolidate into one proper one
I want to use the Traditional->Roth IRA backdoor conversion to maximize money invested into an account that will be tax-free upon withdrawal. Right now I have money in both traditional and roth ira's which will prevent me from backdooring. So I need to make a one-time change to my allocations so I can use this method going forward.
Rating: 8/10
Notes: I sat down, paid a CPA to review my IRA accounts, and made a plan. I have not yet executed that plan, however :…(. Need to set a time and get it done. The plan is: <redacted>
 
Move HSA into investment account
Rating: 8/10
Notes: It didn't take long to move this money. I only moved 1/5th of the total available money, just to get practice. I also am super skeptical investing now that the market is so high. But I'll update this to 10 later this week.
 
Remove managed account elections in 401k ($55/quarter! and can't pick my own allocation)
Rating: 10/10
Notes: Took a few calls, but got it done. Voya is such a scammy company for auto-enrolling me in this >:(
