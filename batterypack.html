            <h4> The battery pack is a multi-disciplinary project combining mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. The pack must house the cells and associated power electronics, and also allow for proper heat transfer to prevent battery fires. For the newest car's battery pack, I worked on the following projects: </h4>

                <h3> High Voltage System Architecture </h3>
                    <h4> As shown in the diagram, the battery pack is connected to the car's high voltage components: the motors, buck converter, and MPPTs. The biggest load on the pack is the motors and motor controllers, which consume most of the pack's power. The buck converter, which converts the pack's high voltage into low voltage, powers all of the vehicle's low power systems. The MPPTs provide a source of power to charge the battery, converting the fluctuating incoming solar radiation into a steady, high-voltage stream of power. </h4>   
                    <h4> The MPPTs for our newest vehicle were reused from a previous vehicle, and had a set input voltage range of 90-110v. This was the most restrictive voltage requirement for the car's high-voltage system, and thus determined the acceptable threshold for our battery pack. </h4>

                <h3> Cell Selection </h3>
                    <h4> As shown in the diagram, there are many metrics on which to evaluate battery types. For the solar car, two metrics were of crucial importance: power capacity and energy density. </h4>
                    <h4> Power capacity is the maximum sustained discharge current from a cell. This metric was
                    determined by the car's maximum power demand, which is set largely by the car's motors (all other electrical loads are much smaller). The motors can request up to 10kW total, which for a 100v electrical bus corresponds to 100A peak draw. Given at least 10 cells in parallel, this would yield a 10 parallel * 10A/cell = 100A current capacity. </h4>
                    <h4> The other key metric for which the batteries were evaluated was energy density. All other factors equal, a higher energy density means more electrical energy available per unit mass, meaning the car can travel farther for a given weight. </h4>
                    <h4> Less important metrics evaluated were temperature range and cost. The car is sometimes driven in hot environments (exceeding 35 degrees C), and the cells need to be able to withstand a few degrees higher. Cost is always a constraint for a student team; all money needs to be raised through sponsorships and grants. </h4>
                    <h4> The average lifetime of a solar car is a few years, and the fraction of that life where the cells are being used is much smaller, so lifetime was not a significant metric. </h4>

                <h3> System Configuration </h3>     
                    <h4> The system configuration is how the cells are arranged in series and parallel in the battery pack's design. Given a fixed number of cells, adding more in series gives a higher voltage, but adding them in parallel gives a higher current capacity. The total number of cells was determined by a regulation which limited the total mass of the battery pack at 20kg. </h4>
                    <h4> Using the Panasonic 18650GA cells, each cell had a mass of roughly 48g and a nominal voltage of 3.6V. The mass of each cell combined with the vehicle regulation limited our total cell count to 20000/48 = 416 cells total. The MPPT voltage range of 90 to 110v determined our series configuration to be 100v / 3.6v = 26 to 28 cells. Of this range, 26 worked the best, given that 26*16 equaled 416 perfectly, meaning our maximum cell count of 416 could be achieved with a 26s16p (26 in series, 16 in parallel) configuration. </h4>
                    <h4> The 26s meant that our pack's nominal voltage would be 26 cells*3.6v = 93.6v. The 16p meant our pack could supply 16*10A = 160A peak currents. </h4>

               <h3> Module and Current Collector Design </h3>
                    <h4> A module was defined by 16 cells in parallel; 26 modules would be strung in series to create the full 416 cell pack. The module had three main parts: the cells (red), the cell holders (green), and the current collectors (pink). </h4>
                    <h4> The cells were spaced allow adequate air flow between each cell. A hexagonal arrangement was chosen to space the cells equally, which can be seen in the spacing of the current collector tabs in pink. </h4>
                    <h4> The cell holders were two structural plates with a hexagonal lattice cut out inside. These were designed to constrain and support the cells, which would otherwise only be held in place at the current collector tabs. These were designed to be laser-cut from PVC or similar polymer material. </h4>
                    <h4> Finally, the current collectors were designed to allow spot-welding of the cell ends onto the metal. These current collectors were made of a cladded metal alloy consisting of a Ni-Steel-Cu-Steel-Ni sandwich. This alloy easily welds onto the cells because of the Nickel, and has low resistivity because of the copper. (add bit about all-cell?) </h4>

                        <h4> The following diagram outlines the internals of the battery box. Each block is a module, of which there are 26. Arrows show the connections between modules, and the red blocks on the sides of each block show their respective polarities. Additionally, each block is labeled with a "T", signifying the presence of a temperature sensor. </h4>
                        <h4> There are other power electronics present as well. The BMS, or battery management system, is a computer which monitors the health of all batteries, and is pictured in the middle. There are switches to disconnect the high and low sides of the battery box, pictured as orange circles near the bottom-middle of the box. There are two fuses to limit the amount of current on the lines in and out of the pack. Finally, there is a current sensor to monitor the amount of power leaving the pack. </h4>   
                        <h4> There is a small block labeled "precharge", which is a resistor/contactor pair used to gradually turn on the motors from idle to full power. When the motors turn on, they present an inductive load demanding high amounts of current, which is regulated by first opening the precharge contactor, forcing current to travel through the precharge resistor. Once the current stabilizes, the precharge contactor closes and allows a low-impedance path between the battery box and motor load. </h4>

                <h3> Heat Transfer </h3>
                    <h4> The lithium-ion cells can be dangerous if used in environments too hot or too cold. Specifically, the cells must charge between 10-45C, and discharge between -20-60C. Of these temperature ranges, the batteries must avoid the 45C discharge condition, since the car races in central Texas, where temperatures regularly approaches 35-40C in the summer. </h4>
                    <h4> To allow charging in these hot conditions, good heat transfer is a must. To achieve this, the battery box was designed with lots of ventilation paths. Specifically, the bottom of the box has angled slots which direct air flowing horizontally up through the cells, allowing warm air to be pushed out of the box. </h4>
                    <h4> The following image shows a thermal simulation of the box performed in SolidWorks' FlowSim tool using worst-case assumptions: 40C ambient temperature, 4W power emissions per cell, and airflow of 0.02m^3/sec airflow. Even given these harsh conditions, the cells still remain 2C below the maximum allowable 45C temperature. </h4>
